    "In this notebook, we present the A* search algorithm, provide an extensive explanation about how it works and provide a code to solve a sliding puzzle. All further mathematical/theoretical explanations are based on chapter 24 of [Cormen et al. (2009)](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-third-edition).\n",

    "The shortest path problem describes the issues of finding the shortest path between two nodes. It is a classical problem in mathematics and computer science with applications in economics (sequential decision making, analysis of social networks, etc.), operations research and transportation or robotics and artificial intelligence. There are plenty of algorithms for solving the shorthest path problem. For instance, the Dijkstra's algorithm was the first that addressed this issue in 1959. The A* algorithm is an alternative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The A* search algorithm can be considered as a informed variation of the Dijkstra's algorithm, as it uses information about path cost and also uses heuristics to find the solution. The latter is one of the main advantages that A* provides compared to Dijkstra's as the use of heuristics is meant to speed up the search. It is also one of the most successful search algorithms to find the shortest path between nodes or graphs. The A* search algorithm was first described in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nilds J. Nilsson and Bertram Raphael."

    "Both the A* and Dijkstra's algorithms can be considered as special cases of dynamic programming. Thus, they are very powerful optimisation techniques that can be applied on a large number of fields, including Economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fields where shortest path algorithms are employed in Economics is the field of networks, which we are especially interested in. For example, there is a vast metaliterature on the importance of citations and affiliations with journals. Investigating those  networks is also approached by economists. Among others, [Jackson and Rogers (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1162/jeea.2005.3.2-3.617) investigate networks where agents profit from indirect relationships. However, networks have also been considered in a more spatial manner by economists, for example by [Chen et al. (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11067-012-9175-1) who compare different shortest path algorithms in the face of travel times in road networks, among them the A* algorithm.\n",
    "Beyond that, the A* algorithm stroke us as an efficient approach that can be used in multifaceted ways. For instance, it serves to solve shortest path problems in Game Theory. To give an example, [Chandrashekar & Narahari (2005)](https://doi.org/10.1007/11600930_8) develop shortest path cooperative games where agents have to go from a starting node to a specified target node in a directed acyclic network. The authors use this framwork to investigate the willingness to share the surplus earned from finding the shortest path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we regard the A* search algorithm as an optimal extension to the QuantEcon notebook on the [shortest path](https://julia.quantecon.org/dynamic_programming/short_path.html) problem. We were motivated to see how this problem can be extended, and what could be a better way to find the shortest path; eventually emplyoing the learning outcomes in our subsequent PhDs and work.\n"

In such riddles, sometimes the goal is to reveal an image by moving their parts in the right positions, which is a game that some might know from their childhood.\n",

    "\n",
    "At the beginning, only the starting and goal nodes are known.\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds, by splitting the nodes into three different categories: known, unknown and completely investigated nodes. Unknown nodes are those that the algorithm has not found yet during the search. Known nodes are those that have been found by the algorithm and to which a path from the starting node is known. Each known node gets an $f(n)$ value assigned:\n",

    "<center> $ f(n) = g(n) + h(n) $ </center>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thereby, $ g(n) $ denotes the cost from the starting node to node $ n $ and $ h(n) $ is a function estimating the cheapest cost from $ n $ to the goal node. The A* algorithm starts by analyising those nodes that are likely to reach their goal node first (e.g. with the lowest $ f(n) $ value assigned). \n",
    "\n",
    "Completely investigated nodes are those to which the shortest path has been found. Those nodes are saved on the so called $\\textit{closed list}$. The other known nodes are saved on the $\\textit{open list}$. Every known and completely investigated node indicates (via an \"arrow\") from which previous node it was reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "A node becomes completely investigated, once all the nodes that can be reached from it are included in the open list (all \"following nodes\" are found). If the following nodes are already in the closed list, they remain in that list and are not investigated again. If a following node is in the open list, it is investigated whether the node is being reachable in a less costly path via this node than in comparison to the node through which it was found previously. If this is the case, the \"arrow\" of the node is updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The A* search algorithm comes to an end, once it has reached the goal node and the goal node is completely investigated. Then tracing back the arrows from the goal, the least costly path is found. The algorithm also terminates, if the open list becomes empty - under those circumstances no path to the goal node exists. Thereby, the function $ h(n) $ is a key element of the algorithm; if it is admissible, A* will always return the least-cost path.\n"

    "### 2.2.2. The heuristic function $ h(n) $\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, A* is complete and optimal only if an admissible heuristic function is used. This means that the real cost to reach goal node from node $ n $ should be smaller than or equal to $ h(n) $. Hence, the heuristic function should never overestimate the cost. Otherwise, the A* algorithm is no longer complete and optimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The heuristic function can be defined in several ways. The most frequent definition is that of the beeline from a node to the goal node. This is due to the fact that via triangular inequality, the distance is never over estimated. The triangular inequality states that for any triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than or equal to the length of the remaining side. Considering the sliding puzzle that we will investigate: As we can move the elements of the puzzle only vertically and horizontally, it is assured that the length of a straight line that goes from the starting node to the goal node is less than or equal to the actual distance the element has to \"travel\" to reach its final position.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other typical examples of admissible heuristic functions are the \"Hamming distance\" and the \"Manhattan distance\". The former takes into account how many elements are in wrong positions, the latter considers the number of moves the elements have to take to reach their final positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also important to note that sometimes the admissibility criterion of the heuristic function is relaxed to speed up the algorithm. Such heuristic functions are called \"ε-admissible\", and the A* algorithms implementing such heuristics are usually referred to as \"A* Epsilon\". Using this approach, we approximate the shortest path to speed up the search at the expense of optimality by relaxing the admissibility criterion. The idea is that we can guarantee that the solution path is no worse than (1 + ε) times the optimal solution path. \n",

    "The A* algorithm works with three types of nodes; known, unknown and completely investigated nodes. For each of those nodes, information has been collected and will be eventually changed through the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we first create a so-called dictionary in which we can save the information on the individual nodes. A dictionary is a data structure in Julia that is somewhat similar to an array or a set but inherits characteristics useful for our problem. A dictionary associates unique identifiers, called the keys, to corresponding values. In our case, the unique identifier will be the position (which is equal to a node in the previous theoretical explanation) - which is a nice characteristic as we want to list every position only once in our list and eventually update its respective information.\n",

    "We will work with the puzzle and understand each combination of elements as a position. For example, the image given above has a Starting position of [8, 1, 7, 4, 5, 6, 2, 0, 3] and a Goal position of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Note that the missing, or empty piece, is denoted by a 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Staying within this example, the positions that can be discovered from the Starting position are the followings:\n",

We divide the final distance by two: imagine only 0 and 1 remain in the wrong positions. The distance would claim this as \"remaining path=2\", thus we divide by two.\n",

    "1. Naming function and Open / Closed list\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by naming the function and stating as the input the starting position and the goal position we want to achieve. The open and closed list are lists of the different positions. Their properties and how points move between those lists have been explained previously. Those lists only contain the positions, their respective H, G and parent-positions remain noted in the dictionary. The lists are defined as sets, which is similar to an array. However, repetitions are not allowed in sets, which is convenient, as we do not want to have the same positions named several times per set (open or closed list).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Write Entry Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We add the starting point to the dictionary. Thereby, we take its position, calculate its H-value, normalise its G-value to 0 and denote its parent by an array of [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]. This position does obviously not exist - this is done as the starting position has no parent; thus we use a fictionary array.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add Entry to Open List\n",
    "\n",
    "We continue by adding the starting-position \"start\" to the open list. The command push! is needed to add something to a set. Later we will also add entries to an array, for which we need the command \"append!\", more on this below.\n",

    "4. The Open List is Non-Empty\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained before, if the algorithm reaches the point at which the open list is empty, the goal point has been found or the algorithm has to come to the conclusion that no path can be found. \n",
    "If the list is non-empty we do the following, as described in this equation: We determine the most promising point from the open list (determine_minimum_f). To see how the algorithm advances (and to double check if it works) we print all those points, together with its G and H-values. We also print the length of the open and closed list. We also include an option how many results shall be printed (display_every_ith_output) as this can make the computation much faster for difficult examples. If the position that is investigated is equal to the goal point, the algorithm has come to its end. Then, as explained previously, we want to determine this \"shortest path\". We do this by going back through all the parent-relationships, meaning we note the path from goal to start. We do this as long as the parent position (at its first index) is greater than -1, meaning until the start (whose parent was an array of -1s). In the end, we reverse all entries in \"path\" to actually obtain the path from start --> goal.\n",

    "\n",
    " - An H-function where the cost of moving is always lower or equal to the actual cost guarantees that the shorthest path is found, but it may be very slow in some cases (this is the case with our Hamming Admissible function). The lower the estimated cost to reach the goal is in comparison the the cost of reaching this node, the more nodes A* will expand making the algorithm slower.\n",
    "\n",
    " - An H-function that can estimate the cost with 100% accuracy assures that A* follows the best path and never expand anything else, which makes it very fast. As such a function is also admissible, the shorthest path is always found. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to produce a perfectly accurate H-function.\n",
    "\n",
    " - An H-function that overestimates the cost is not guaranteed to find the shortest path, but it finds a path much more quickly (Hamming Weighted Non-Admissible, Manhattan Alternative Non-Admissible, Manhattan Weighted Non-Admissible in our case). \n",

In some cases, it is enough to find a \"good\" path instead of a \"perfect\" path which means we can speed up the search and relax the admissibility criterion. Depending on what we want, we can always adjust the H-function accordingly which is a very useful property of the algorithm."
